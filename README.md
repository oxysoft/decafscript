A silly scripting language for learning purposes.

It is called Decafscript because instead of being very caffeinated like other coffee languages, this one is very unenergetic!

It should never be used for production because it is going to be terribly optimized. (If it actually reaches a usable state in the future)

A better readme coming later.
